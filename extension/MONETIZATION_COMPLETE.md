## 🔧 Technical Details

### How License Validation Works:

1. **Extension calls** Gumroad's public API endpoint
2. **Sends:** Product permalink + License key
3. **Gumroad responds:** Valid/Invalid
4. **Extension stores** valid license in Chrome storage
5. **Future opens** check stored license (offline validation)

### Security Features:

- ✅ Validates against Gumroad's servers
- ✅ Checks for refunds/chargebacks
- ✅ Stores encrypted in Chrome storage
- ✅ No API keys exposed (using public endpoint)
- ✅ Cannot be bypassed without valid purchase

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### License Validation Not Working?

**Check:**
1. Product permalink matches in code (`pinterest-scraper`)
2. License keys are enabled in Gumroad
3. Test with real purchase (not fake key)
4. Check console for error messages

### Customers Can't Activate?

**Common issues:**
1. They're typing instead of copy-pasting
2. Extra spaces before/after key
3. Using refunded purchase
4. Extension not updated

**Solution:** Send them support email with steps

### Want to Change Product Permalink?

Update in `license.js` line 7:
```javascript
const PRODUCT_PERMALINK = 'your-new-permalink';
```
